	* Tupleizing and UntupleFunction now handle nested function definitions
	* Subdirectories reverted to v0.5 bytecodehacks, since the only change
	I've ever made was to accidentally change line endings in them to CRLF

1999-09-09  Evan Simpson  <evan@4-am.com>

	* Tupleizing a function now omits globals

	* New UntupleFunction re-applies globals, with automatic initialization
	of variables to None, since there's no way to check if they exist.
        It also includes $functions, and checks __builtins__ handling.

	* Moved all bytecode manipulation into Munge_window class, which uses
        op.execute to maintain information about who did what to the stack.

	* Added Munger which re-enables creation of dictionary literals.

	* Made all Mungers load frequently used functions from the global dict
	into the local instead of storing them in co_consts.

	* Simplified GuardedOps and turned off test Guard.

	* Wrote lots of docstring.

1999-08-28  Evan Simpson  <evan@4-am.com>

	* Ripped out Fleshy acquisition-style class and added
	CycleHandle in an attempt to improve speed.

	* code_editor.py: Added "as_tuple" to Function and EditableCode
	to provide (hopefully) pickleable representations.  Their __init__s
	now accept these tuples.

	* Added VSExec.py (the point of all this), which provides facilities
	for compiling arbitrary blocks of code with heavy restrictions.

1999-06-11  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* a monumental amount has changed. I haven't been keeping the
	ChangeLog up to date, sorry.

1999-05-16  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* doc/bch.tex: documented macro and macros.

	* macros.py: added basic library of macros. 

	* setq2.py: does same job as setq.py, but uses the new macro
	package.

	* macro.py It's a macro packages of sorts. Needs documentation.

1999-05-15  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* inline.py: Substantially rewritten to use find_function_call,
	and to support keyword arguments. No varags yet.

	* setq.py Added changes written by Christian Tismer (now converts
	globals to locals)

1999-05-13  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* Release 0.11 - cleaned up production of documentation following
	advice from the documentation master, Fred L. Drake.

1999-05-12  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* Release 0.10.

	* doc/ There's documentation (gasp)

1999-05-10  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* inline.py: Python now has inline functions! Bet you never
	expected that.

	* It's all changing again! Much polish, some docstrings,
	everything rewritten to use code_editor that wasn't already, many
	style fixes.

1999-05-06  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* attr_freeze.py: implement an attribute freezer that works.

	* xapply2.py: implement xapply for functions (again!) using the
	new code editing framework from code_editor.py.

	* code_editor.py: That's more like it!

1999-05-04  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* attr_freeze.py: implements a (buggy) attempt at freezing
	attribute references.

	* read_code.py,opbases.py,ops.py,write_ops.py,
	common.py,__init__.py: Much stuff added/changed. It not pretty or
	internally consistent yet. I might bash on it some more some
	time. I'm afraid I don't feel like explaining myself properly yet
	either.
	

1999-05-02  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* README,ChangeLog: Added.

	* xapply.py: Added, following prompting by Christian Tismer.

	* closure.py: Made improvements suggested by Tim Peters.
